## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to discern the trip duration, checkout times, and according to weekday and gender. For this analysis, we are using a cleaned version of the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv dataset where we re-formatted the "trip_duration" column from python's integer datatype to datetime data type.

## Results
The following links provided below will show the tableau view of the worksheet, with a brief summary of the data visualisation noted below:

Description: The number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. Men and Women both use the citi-bike frequently on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 5:00pm and 6:00pm. However, since men are recorded to use the citi-bike more than women, the heatmaps highlights the difference in each gender's aggregate usage of the bike per weekday and hour.

## Summary
The data depicted on each visualisation reveals which users use the citi-bike the most and which users use the citi-bike the least. Marketing teams can either direct their efforts to appeal to their most popular demographic of users on certain weekdays and hours or try to figure out why less women use citi-bike than men.
